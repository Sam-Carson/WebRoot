            <p>
                w3schools has been my go to site for quick references and help when whenever
                I have questions about HTML, CSS or JavaScript. What makes w3 so useful for this course
                is the easy access to responsive web design that is featured under the HTML and CSS section. 
                Something that sets w3schools apart form other resourceful material is there 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp">How to</a> section. Look for anything you 
                may need help with and you can very likely find it there.<br /></p>

            <p>
                DesignCourse is a Youtube channel created by a fullstack developer named Gary. Nowadays, you can 
                learn just about anything on Youtube and because of the complexity of software development, having 
                a video to watch and follow along can be much more convenient than reading documentation. I'm personally
                a visual learner so this makes things much easier for. I've followed along with a few of these videos
                in the past and I can vouch for Gary, he puts out some pretty neat stuff. His videos will help beginners
                develop their HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. <br /></p>
